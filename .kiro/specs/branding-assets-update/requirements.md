# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the CorpsMart application to use the existing `market_square.svg` as the primary logo and icon across all touchpoints, and `corpsmart.png` as the application screenshot in the PWA manifest. Currently, the app uses text-based branding and references non-existent icon files, creating an inconsistent brand experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the CorpsMart logo consistently displayed across the application, so that I have a cohesive brand experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any page of the application THEN the navigation SHALL display the market_square.svg logo instead of text-only branding
2. WHEN I view the application on mobile devices THEN the mobile navigation SHALL display the market_square.svg logo with appropriate sizing
3. WHEN I view the application favicon in browser tabs THEN it SHALL display the market_square.svg converted to appropriate favicon formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user installing the PWA, I want to see proper app icons and screenshots, so that the installation experience feels professional and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install the PWA THEN the system SHALL use market_square.svg-based icons for all required sizes (192x192, 512x512)
2. WHEN I view the PWA installation prompt THEN it SHALL display corpsmart.png as the application screenshot
3. WHEN I install the app on iOS THEN it SHALL use the market_square.svg-based apple-touch-icon
4. WHEN the PWA manifest is loaded THEN all icon references SHALL point to existing files derived from market_square.svg

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the logo to be responsive and accessible, so that it works well across different screen sizes and for users with disabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL have appropriate alt text for screen readers
2. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the logo SHALL scale appropriately without losing quality
3. WHEN displayed in both light and dark themes THEN the logo SHALL maintain good contrast and visibility
4. WHEN the logo is clicked THEN it SHALL navigate to the main listings page as expected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app shortcuts and PWA features to use consistent iconography, so that the experience feels polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view PWA shortcuts THEN they SHALL use the market_square.svg-based icons
2. WHEN I access the app through shortcuts THEN the icons SHALL be consistent with the main app icon
3. WHEN the manifest is updated THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work without breaking changes
